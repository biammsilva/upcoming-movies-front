## Architecture

I had choose Angular because it was the only framework that I already had work in big projects. So, as I took that risk on back-end, I hadn't on the front-end.

## Build Instructions

### Requirements:
* NodeJs >= 10;
* Npm >= 6;

### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run the application:
```
ng serve
```

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


## External Libs:

I used express.js to get up the server because is the easiest way that I already had made to do it.
I used material design because it has a big support in angular to do it and I think that is prettier than bootstrap :p.
I used flex-layout to use the material design layout combined with flexbox.
